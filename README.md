# Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch

As a data science practionier, I feel it is important to understand what the algorithms you're using do under the hood. There is no better way to test our understanding than by implementing these. This is my attempt at implementing the algorithms. My focus here is to write a functional base version as opposed to a full blown implementaion available in scikit-learn.

List of Algorithms:

- K-Means
  - [R](https://github.com/santhoshhari/from_scratch/blob/master/k-means/k-means.R)
  - [Python](https://github.com/santhoshhari/from_scratch/blob/master/k-means/k-means.py)
- Decision Trees (Python)
  - [Regressor](https://github.com/santhoshhari/from_scratch/blob/master/decision_tree/decision_tree_classifier.py)
  - [Classifier](https://github.com/santhoshhari/from_scratch/blob/master/decision_tree/decision_tree_classifier.py)
- Random Forest (Python)
  - Regressor
  - Classifier
- Gradient Boosting (Adaboost, Python)
  - Regressor
